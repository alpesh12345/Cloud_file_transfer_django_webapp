# Cloud file transfer django webapp

We created a file sharing system by Django Framework. We used HTML, CSS, Javascript for frontend and making the website dynamic. We had written client/server side for file transfer in python (Socket Programming) and integrated it into the website with Django.

Run storage.py at device/instance where you had storage for files.
make changes of IP and port number in info.py for both client.py and storage.py

Run python manage.py runserver to start webapp
